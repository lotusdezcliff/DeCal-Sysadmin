DeCal-Sysadmin
Welcome to my personal DeCal-Sysadmin repository — a learning sandbox where I explore and practice system administration topics inspired by DeCal courses and beyond.

🧰 What's Inside
This repo includes:

Lab scripts and setup guides

Shell/Bash exercises

Notes on Linux, networking, and basic sysadmin tools

Configuration files and system tweaks I've experimented with

🖥️ Project Purpose
Not affiliated with any official course — this is my own collection for learning, testing, and sharing what I’ve picked up in system administration. If you're tinkering too, feel free to use anything here as reference or fork away!

🚀 Setup
Clone the repo to dive in:

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeCal-Sysadmin.git
cd DeCal-Sysadmin
</pre>
Make sure you're using a Linux machine or VM to follow along with the exercises.

💡 About Me
Just someone curious about systems, automation, and the magic of the terminal. Always learning, always tweaking.
